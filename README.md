## Project Summary
The experiment will evaluate the performance of some popular deep learning models, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, and ensemble-based neural networks, on five different datasets. We will build each model on top of two separate feature extractions to capture information within the text. 

The result shows that the __word embedding provides a robust feature extractor__ to all the models in making a better final prediction. The experiment also highlights __the effectiveness of the ensemble-based__ and __temporal convolutional neural network__ in achieving good performances and even competing with the state-of-the-art benchmark models.
